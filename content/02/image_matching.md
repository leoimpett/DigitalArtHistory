Image Matching
----------------------

One of the first tasks of Computer Vision through the 1990s and 2000s was *image matching* - being able to tell when two closely-related images are, in fact, of the same object. It's important to understand that this part of computer vision is still closely related to *robotics*, an embodied analysis, rather than the disembodied analysis of images from social media or collections of paintings, more common to the digital humanities. 

There are several reasons you might want to do this - matching images from two cameras to get a 3D view (steroscopic vision), being able to detect particular objects to understand the world around you, being able to tell what's changed in a video (i.e. what is not matched). It's also the basis for the notion of 'image similarity' and of an image-based search engine, a discussion we will continue into the very current topic of Convolutional Neural Networks.
