# Building and publishing your book

Once you've added content and configured your book, it's time to
build the raw material that Jekyll will use to turn your book into a website.
We'll also cover how to turn this book into the HTML for a website that can
be served online.

## Build the book's markdown

Now that you've got the files installed content is in the book, you can build
your book.

Build your book by running the following command:

```
jupyter-book build mybookname/
```

This will:

* Use the links specified in the `_data/toc.yml` file (pointing to files in `/content/`) and
  do the following:
  * Run `nbconvert` to turn the `.ipynb` files into markdown
  * Replace relative image file paths so that they work on your new built site
  * Clean up formatting issues for things like MathJax to display properly
  * Place all these generated files in the `mybookname/_build/` directory.

Note that `jupyter-book` will automatically update any files in `_build/` that are older
than the timestamp of the corresponding file in your `content/` folder.

From here, you have **two options**

1. **Option 1: GitHub builds the site for you**:

   By default, pushing a repository
   cloned from Jupyter Book will tell GitHub to use Jekyll to build the repository
   when you push changes (your repository is configured properly on GitHub).
   Simply tell GitHub to build a site from your repo, then push the changes to
   your GitHub repo and that's it!

2. **Option 2: Build your site's HTML locally**:

   Building your book's site locally lets you preview your book locally before you
   push it online. It also gives you a bit more functionality than using
   GitHub Pages to build your book. However, it also requires you to install
   Docker or Singularity (containerization platforms) _or_
   Ruby (an open source programming language).
   If you'd like to build your site locally then jump to the next section.

## Build the book's site HTML locally

Once you've generated the markdown for your notebooks and installed the
necessary dependencies. You are ready to build your site HTML.

Ensure that your notebooks have been converted to markdown, there should be a
collection of them in `_build/`.

In order to locally build your site's HTML with Jekyll, you'll need to either install
a container software (Docker or Singularity) or Ruby.

In our experience, we've found that [containers](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container)
provide an easier installation for most systems.
If you are developing on a system where you have administrator privileges
(i.e., you have `root` permissions), we recommend you use [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/).

We also provide instructions for using [Singularity](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/2.6/user-guide/quick_start.html),
an alternate containerization software for systems where you do not have administrator privileges.
To learn more about using containers, please see the
[Docker for scientists guide](https://neurohackweek.github.io/docker-for-scientists/).

### Building your site locally with Containers: Docker

First, you'll need to make sure you have Docker installed.
There are [installation instructions for each operating system](https://hub.docker.com/search/?type=edition&offering=community)
to guide you through this process.

Once Docker is available on your system, you can build the image locally with:

```bash
docker pull emdupre/jupyter-book
```

You can then access this image with:

```bash
docker run --rm --security-opt label:disable  \
   -v /full/path/to/your/book:/srv/jekyll \
   -p 4000:4000 \
   -it -u 1000:1000 \
   emdupre/jupyter-book bundle exec jekyll serve --host 0.0.0.0
```

If you navigate to `http://0.0.0.0:4000/jupyter-book/` in your browser,
you should see a preview copy of your book.
If you instead see an error, please try to update your local book;
see [the Jupyter Book FAQ section](https://jupyter.org/jupyter-book/guide/04_faq.html#how-can-i-update-my-book)
for more details on how to do so.

### Building your site locally with Containers: Singularity

If you are on a system where you do not have administrator privileges (such as a shared
computing cluster), you will not be able to use Docker.
Instead, you can use Singularity.
First, you'll need to check with your resource manager that Singularity is available
on your system.

You can then create a Jupyter Book Singularity image using:

```bash
singularity build jupyter-book.simg docker://emdupre/jupyter-book
```

Next, you can access this image with:

```bash
singularity run -B /full/path/to/your/book:/srv/jekyll \
    --pwd /srv/jekyll \
    jupyter-book.simg bundle exec jekyll serve
```

And that's it! If you navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:4000/jupyter-book/` in your browser,
you should see a preview copy of your book.

### Building your site locally with Ruby

You can also choose to build your site locally without a container.
In this case, you'll need Ruby, an open-source programming language, to build your site's
HTML with Jekyll. The easiest way to install Ruby on *nix systems is to use
the *`conda`* package manager:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge ruby
```

Once you have Ruby installed, the conda-built clang compiler for your system need to be installed. Details depend on your OS.

#### On OSX

Two steps are needed on OSX. First, install the *`conda`'s* clang compiler:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge clangxx_osx-64
```

If you are running OSX 10.14 (Mojave) you also need to install system libraries in
the default *nix locations by running

```bash
open /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg
```

#### On Linux

Install *`conda`'s* clang compiler:

```bash
gxx_linux-64
```

#### Install Ruby plugins

Finally, run

```bash
make install
```

which will install Bundler (a Ruby dependency management tool) and then install the plugins
needed to build the site for your book.

You can then build the site locally by running:

```
make site
```

Alternatively, you can preview your book's site locally by running this command:

```
make serve
```

This should open up a port on your computer with a live version of the book.


### When should you build the HTML locally?

You might ask: if GitHub pages can build my site automatically from the markdown files, why
build it locally? The main reason for this is that you get more flexibility by building locally
and serving raw HTML, as opposed to auto-building the site with GitHub-pages.

In particular, if you wish to use any **extra Jekyll plugins**, such as the `jekyll-scholar` plugin that
enables you to add citations and bibliographies, then you need to build your site
locally as HTML. GitHub-pages doesn't let you enable any extra plugins if it auto-builds your site.

## Create an *online* repository for your book

You've created your book on your own computer, but you haven't yet added it
online. This section covers the steps to create your own GitHub repository,
and to add your book's content to it.

1. First, log-in to GitHub, then go to the "create a new repository" page:

https://github.com/new

2. Next, add a name and description for your book. You can choose whatever
   initialization you'd like.

3. Now, clone the empty repository to your computer:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<my-org>/<my-book-name>
   ```

4. Copy all of your book files and folders (what was created when you ran `jupyter-book create mybook`)
   into the new repository. For example, if you created your book locally with `jupyter-book create mylocalbook`
   and your online repository is called `myonlinebook`, the command would be:

   ```bash
   cp -r mylocalbook/* myonlinebook/
   ```

   This will copy over the local book files into the online book folder.

5. Commit the new files to the repository in `myonlinebook/`:

   ```bash
   cd myonlinebook
   git add ./*
   git commit -m "adding my first book!"
   git push
   ```

That's it!

## Publish your book online with GitHub Pages

Once you've built the markdown for your book (in `_build`) or built the HTML
for your book (in `_site`), you can push your book contents to GitHub so that
others can access your book. To do so, follow these steps:

0. Confirm that your site files are built. You should see a
   collection of markdown files/folders in the `_build` folder,
   or a collection of HTML in your `_site/` folder.
1. Commit and push the changes to your repository.
2. Enable GitHub site building for your repository.

   From your GitHub repository, click `Settings` then scroll down to the
   `GitHub Pages` section. You should see the message `Your site is published at <YOUR-URL>`.
   Ensure that you're building from the correct folder.

3. Go to the URL listed at `<YOUR-URL>` and you should see your live site.
