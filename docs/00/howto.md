## How-to 

For many of the simpler worksheets, you should be able to run the code in the browser using a system called Binder; click the 'Interact' button to go to the Binder page, or click the 'Thebelab' button to run the Binder within this website. Both are free services, and are a little slow to start, but generally work reliably. 

The easiest thing way to run this code offline is to install Jupyter and Python together by downloading [Anaconda](https://anaconda.com/distribution) on your local machine. At that point, you can work through each notebook by clicking the 'Download' link at the top of the page.
