# Auto matching



This is bipartheid graph matching. 

Various constraints - for instance, we might know that all of A map onto B, or every B has an A, or both A and B are connected to maximum one opposite number, etc. 

We're going to try graph matching on a set dataset, the Nova Planatorum (scanned book vs vatican prints). Try it with SIFT at first.
